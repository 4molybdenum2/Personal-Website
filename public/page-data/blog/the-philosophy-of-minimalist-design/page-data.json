Although no all-encompassing description of minimalism can be found on the internet, one can say that it is \"removing the distraction of excess and focusing more on things that matter the most\". The aspect of 'minimalism' that I am going to talk about is 'Minimalist Design'. (If you google a little, you will understand that minimalism is not limited to design per se.)</p>\n<p>The first question that comes to mind when developing an application or product is whether it works. While it may seem obvious to do so, many people fail to pay attention to the design of the end product, which is a disaster in itself. You need to have a captivating look to your product that will draw and hold the attention of people.</p>\n<p>This is where \"minimalist design\" comes into play. Imagine staring at a blue sky on a beautiful day. Clean, uncluttered and simple - the feeling of peaceful satisfaction. This \"Less is more\" ideology possesses a certain attraction that helps showcase a product's true form.</p>\n<p>Steve Jobs, one of the founders of Apple Inc., felt that design simplicity should be linked with making products easy to use. However, these goals may not always go together. A design might be so sleek and simple that the end-user finds it intimidating or unfriendly to navigate. </p>\n<p>\"The main thing in our design is that we have to make things intuitively obvious,\" Jobs told a crowd of design mavens. For example, he extolled the desktop metaphor he was creating for the Macintosh: \"People know how to deal with a desktop intuitively. If you walk into an office, there are papers on the desk. The one on top is the most important. People know how to switch priorities. Part of the reason we model our computers on metaphors like the desktop is that we can leverage this experience that we already have.\"</p>\n<p>Jobs was such a staunch believer in prioritising the clean design of products that he decided to have all of Apple's manufacturing factories have white interior walls, even though it was more expensive.</p>\n<p>To get started with the ideas of minimalist design on our own, we need to observe how others have worked on them. Once again, googling it is the best place to begin. Sites such as Dribbble, Behance, DeviantArt, and Pinterest can get your creative juices flowing. For those who are interested in web development, Awwwards is a great place to get inspired. Fair warning: the websites featured over there can be difficult for beginners to implement. </p>\n<p>Moreover, choosing the right fonts and spacing plays a massive role in creating a good design. I would suggest using CSS/SCSS for all design purposes because they give you absolute control over your design. </p>\n<p>That's all I can say about what you should do. You have limitless possibilities when you explore beyond the frameworks of your work. Just remember, \"Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.\" </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 12, 2017","path":"/blog/the-philosophy-of-minimalist-design","title":"The Philosophy of Minimalist Design"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
