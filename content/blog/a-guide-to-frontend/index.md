A Guide To Front-End Web Development in 2020
So it's been a semester since I joined college and found my interest in working as a developer. I am what you might call self-taught and have been doing so for the last couple of months and found myself greatly interested in web development.

It would sound 'weird' but everything you need to learn about any topic is freely available over the internet and I, for the most part, learned everything with the help of Youtube and Blog Posts on Medium and other online platforms.

HTML, CSS and Javascript
You need to start with the basics of course…by that I mean HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. These are the fundamentals and you need to learn these before you tackle something a little bit more complex. But remember if you are good at the above-mentioned skills it becomes easier to learn new concepts as they come.

Responsive Web Design
Next comes Responsive web design. It allows you to design websites that will be 'good-looking' on both mobile devices and your PC. You need CSS frameworks for these and I would suggest you look into Bootstrap or Materialize. Also going through SASS is a good option as it simplifies a lot of things vanilla CSS does.

Version Control System
After you are adept at the above things I would suggest you look into a tech Version Control and software such as Git and Github. It makes your life a lot easier by making things like team projects a 'piece of cake' to say simply.

At this point, you can call yourself a Basic Front-End Developer (Hooray!).

Front-End Frameworks
Next comes front end frameworks (yes…the big boys!) like React, Angular, Vue which will make your life a lot easier than working with plain HTML and Javascript as you were working with until now. You get to work with HTML and Javascript as a single entity (wow!).

State Management
State Management comes next and to be honest, it was quite a complicated topic for me but with the right resources, I would say it would hardly take you 2 to 3 hours to understand it well to apply it in your projects. There are many applications you can go for State Management but I would say Redux is quite the thing you need to master it.

Now comes some advanced topic you can learn right away but I would suggest you try to build some of your front-end websites with the things you learned before proceeding.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is the next sweet thing you are looking for to make your websites faster and your job a lot simpler. Next JS (for React) and Nuxt (for Vue) are the tools for and what it does is renders the application server-side before sending it to the client, which is better for SEO (Search Engine Optimization), has File System Routing, Static Exporting, and other advantages.

Static Site Generators (SSG)
Also, look into Static Site Generators such as Gatsby (for React) and Gridsome (for Vue) that makes static sites and helps in data fetching during build time.

When to use SSR v/s SSG
With SSR, the pages are generated at runtime on the server-side, this means that the server must be able to execute Node.js to generate the pages. Whereas in SSG, all the files are generated at build time as static pages and it is easy to host your website on static file hosting platforms like Netlify and also Github Pages.

Pros of SSR:
1.Content is always up-to-date.
2.Rebuild is not required when content changes.

Pros of SSG:
1.Really fast website
2.Can deploy to a static CDN
3.Security: attack surface of a static website is minimal

We generally use SSG for websites which are mainly meant for promotional or UI/UX purposes. Also they can be used to host personal blogs. They are extremely easy to develop and handle.
But, ultimately it is up to the user which he/she prefers.

TypeScript
This is an optional topic but Typescript extends JavaScript to add static type checking and the latest ECMAScript features, such as async/await, classes or arrow functions. Static type checking in place means that the compiler will notify you when you are trying to use a function or variable in a manner that does not match its signature. This also gives code editors the ability to provide better code navigation and refactoring capabilities.

With this, you are now what we call a Front-End Wizard. This was not everything…because new technology is released every day and to stay at the top of your game, always keep an eye out for the new technologies. So, 'Stay calm and keep coding…'
